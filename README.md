# Multi-Server React Agent with LangChain and Google Gemini AI

This project demonstrates how to create a multi-server React agent using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Google Generative AI**. The agent can interact with tools hosted on different servers.

## Features

- Multi-server tool integration using `MultiServerMCPClient`.
- React-style agent creation with `create_react_agent`, also has `tool binding`.
- Google Generative AI (`Gemini 2.5 Flash`) as the language model.
- Asynchronous agent interaction using Python's `asyncio`.
- Example math tool integration for addition and multiplication.
